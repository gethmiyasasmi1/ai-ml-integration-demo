# AI & ML Integration (Emerging Must-Have)

This repository demonstrates how to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) into real-world applications using Python. It includes a trained machine learning model, a Flask API for serving predictions, and a simple chatbot using NLP.

## Features

- Train a machine learning model (Iris classification)
- Serve model predictions using a Flask API
- Communicate with the model through an API call
- Create a basic chatbot using NLTK
- Step-by-step integration guide
